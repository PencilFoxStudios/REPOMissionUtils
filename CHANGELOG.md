# Changelog
## B1.0.2 (5/26/2025)

- **Tweak:** Slightly adjusted the font size of the mission messages to improve readability.

## B1.0.1 (5/25/2025)
- **Feature:** Added config option: ``ShowMessagesToDeadPlayers`` to allow/deny showing messages to dead players.
- **Tweak:** Changed ``README.md`` to better reflect the purpose of the plugin.
